In this election, Nayib Bukele, the incumbent, claimed a landslide victory in Salvador's presidential race, securing over 85% of the vote. This remarkable win underscores his popularity and the approval of his governance style. The election was marked by high voter turnout and was seen as a referendum on Bukele's administration, which has been both praised for its effectiveness and criticized for its authoritarian tendencies. Bukele's victory cements his position in Salvadoran politics and sets the stage for his next term, with significant implications for the country's direction.
